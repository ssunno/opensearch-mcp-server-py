## OpenSearch MCP Server
**opensearch-mcp-server-py** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OpenSearch that enables AI assistants to interact with OpenSearch clusters. It provides a standardized interface for AI models to perform operations like searching indices, retrieving mappings, and managing shards through both stdio and Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocols.

**Key features:**
- Seamless integration with AI assistants and LLMs through the MCP protocol
- Support for both stdio and SSE server transports
- Built-in tools for common OpenSearch operations
- Easy integration with Claude Desktop and LangChain
- Secure authentication using basic auth or IAM roles

## Installing opensearch-mcp-server-py
Opensearch-mcp-server-py can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opensearch-mcp-server-py/) via pip:
```
pip install opensearch-mcp-server-py
```

## Available tools
- ListIndexTool: Lists all indices in OpenSearch.
- IndexMappingTool: Retrieves index mapping and setting information for an index in OpenSearch.
- SearchIndexTool: Searches an index using a query written in query DSL and supports optional ``size``, ``from``, ``sort``, and ``aggs`` parameters.
- GetShardsTool: Gets information about shards in OpenSearch.

### SearchIndexTool parameters

The search request body supports common OpenSearch options:

- **index** – name of the index to search.
- **query** – query DSL describing which documents to match.
- **size** – maximum number of hits to return (defaults to 10 if not provided).
- **from** – starting offset for hits (useful for pagination).
- **sort** – sorting criteria for the results.
- **aggs** – aggregations to compute over matched documents.
